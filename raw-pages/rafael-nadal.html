        <h2>Rafael Nadal</h2>

<br>
<br>

        
<br>
<br>
Rafael Nadal Parera[pron 1] (born 3 June 1986) is a Spanish professional tennis player. Nadal has been ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 209 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal has won 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14 French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP-level singles titles, including 36 Masters titles and an Olympic gold medal, with 63 of these on clay courts. Nadal is one of only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles.[b] His 81 consecutive wins on clay constitute the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.


<br>
<br>
        For over a decade, Nadal has led men's tennis along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the Big Three.[c] At the start of his professional career, Nadal became one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching the world No. 2 ranking and winning 16 titles before turning 20, including his first French Open and six Masters events. Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in a historic Wimbledon final, his first major victory off clay. He followed up his win with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, then-24-year-old Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass, and clay) in the same year (Surface Slam).

                After two injury-plagued seasons, Nadal returned to the Tour in 2013, reaching 14 finals, winning two majors and five Masters events including the US Open Series sweep (Summer Slam). He continued his dominance at the French Open, securing six titles, two US Open titles, an Australian Open title, and an Olympic doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics with Marc López. Nadal surpassed his joint-record with Djokovic and Federer for the most Grand Slam men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became one of four men in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles.

                        As a left-handed player, one of Nadal's main strengths is his forehand, which he hits with a high degree of topspin. He also regularly places among the Tour leaders in percentage of return games, return points, and break points won. Nadal has won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award five times and was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021. Time named Nadal one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2022. He is a recipient of the Grand Cross of Royal Order of Sports Merit, Grand Cross of Order of the Second of May, the Grand Cross of Naval Merit, and the Medal of the City of Paris. Representing Spain, he has won two Olympic gold medals, and led the nation to four Davis Cup titles. Nadal has also opened a tennis academy in Mallorca, and is an active philanthropist.

Early life
        
<br>
<br>
Rafael Nadal Parera was born on 3 June 1986 in Manacor, a town on the island of Mallorca in the Balearic Islands, Spain, to parents Ana María Parera Femenías and Sebastián Nadal Homar.[7] His father is a businessman who owns an insurance company, a glass and window company (Vidres Mallorca), and the restaurant Sa Punta. His mother once owned a perfume shop, but gave it up to raise Nadal and his younger sister, María Isabel.[8] One of his uncles, Miguel Ángel Nadal, is a retired professional footballer who played for RCD Mallorca, FC Barcelona and the Spanish national team.[9] As a child, he idolized Barcelona striker Ronaldo, and through his uncle was given access to the Barcelona team dressing room to have a photo taken with the Brazilian.[10] Another of his uncles, tennis coach Toni Nadal, introduced him to that game when he was three years old.[11]
        
        
<br>
<br>
Nadal started to play tennis at the Manacor Tennis Club, where Toni worked as a coach, hitting his first few shots with his uncle.[8][11] Nadal initially found tennis boring compared with football, which he often played on the streets of Manacor with his friends.[8][12] He began to play tennis more consistently when he was five, and Toni quickly realized that his young nephew had both the passion and talent to be a serious player.[11] Nadal usually played tennis in a group, but Toni deliberately picked on him during the sessions, shouting at him rather than the other kids, and making him be the one who picked up the balls and swept the courts afterwards.[8] In his 2011 autobiography, he admitted being afraid of Toni and dreaded having solo practice sessions with him.[13] Nadal even admitted that he would sometimes return home from tennis lessons crying and spoke with his mother about what he was being put through. His father had expressed concern too, but the family decided it was best for Nadal to continue training with his uncle.[14]
        
        
<br>
<br>
At age 8, Nadal won an under-12 regional tennis championship; at the time he was also a promising football player.[8][15] This win inspired Toni to train Nadal more intensively, and his uncle, after studying Nadal's then-two-handed forehand stroke, encouraged him to play left-handed, as it would give him a natural advantage on the tennis court.[15][7] The transition was difficult for Nadal, but Toni helped him make the change, getting him to try it for just 20 minutes per day before gradually increasing that time until he fully adjusted himself to it.[8]

Tennis career
        
<br>
<br>
1997–2000: Juniors
        
<br>
<br>
Nadal won the Spanish junior championships in 1997 and 1998, beating Ricardo Villacorta and Marcel Granollers respectively.[16][17] In 1998 he completed the double as a junior, winning the Spanish championship in doubles with his great friend Tomeu Salvá, beating Diáz and Granollers in the final.[16] Nadal then reached the final of the U14 Spanish championship at the age of 12, a feat that remains unmatched, losing to Juan Sanchez de Luna in straight sets.[16][18] In late 1998, Nadal won the season-ending U12 Junior Masters at Stuttgart, beating future world No. 5 Kevin Anderson in the final.[19]
        
        
<br>
<br>
In February 1998, Nadal won the Open Super 12, an unofficial world championship for U12 players held in Auray. It was the first time that Nadal competed outside of Spain and he beat the 1997 winner Jamie Murray in the final.[20] At the time, Nadal was still hesitating between football and tennis, partly because his uncle Miguel Ángel was preparing to compete in the 1998 FIFA World Cup with Spain, but in the end it was Auray who decided it.[21] In a letter in French that he sent to the organizers in 2010, Nadal stated that winning this tournament helped him make the decision to "opt for tennis and try an international career".[20][21] Latter in 1998, when Nadal was runner-up in the U14 event Spanish championship, he was still playing football.[8] Nadal's father told him he had to choose between football and tennis so that his schoolwork would not deteriorate entirely. Nadal said: "I chose tennis. Football had to stop straight away."[15]
        
        
<br>
<br>
In 1999, the 12-year-old Nadal was already playing in the U14 circuit of the ETA Junior Tour, currently known as the Tennis Europe Junior Tour, winning the prestigious Tim Essonne,[22] and finishing the year at No. 69.[23] Nadal then dominated the U14 circuit in 2000, collecting two of the most prestigious trophies of the year at Les Petits As in Tarbes, beating home favourite Julien Gely in the final,[16][23][24] and the European Junior Masters in Prato.[16][25] On the same day he turned 14, Nadal won the Sport Goofy Trophy, held in Getxo, beating Granollers in the final.[26][27] In July, Nadal finally won the U14 Spanish championships, beating his friend and training partner Tomeu Salvá in the final.[16][28] He broke a finger on his left hand during the first round, but still won the tournament anyways despite gripping the racquet with his four good fingers, his pinkie dangling.[28][29] As a member of the Spanish national team, Nadal won the 2000 ITF World Junior Championship for players under 14, winning his matches in both singles and doubles (paired with Marcel Granollers) in a 3–0 win over Russia.[30] Nadal ended 2000 at No. 5 of the ETA rankings for U14s.[23]
        
        

<br>
<br>

By the time Nadal was 14, he had made a name for himself in the Spanish junior circuit by winning multiple age group titles.[14] Those achievements earned him a tennis scholarship in Barcelona, and the Spanish tennis federation requested that Nadal leave Mallorca and move to Barcelona to continue his tennis training.[8] His family turned down this request, partly because they feared his education would suffer,[15] but also because Toni said, "I don't want to believe that you have to go to America or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home."[8][11] Furthermore, Nadal already was by then practicing three times a week at Palma with his childhood idol and fellow Majorcan, the former World No. 1 Carlos Moyá, who later became Nadal’s mentor and confidant,[8][11] and whom Nadal beat in 2000, at the time still a Top-10 player, in an exhibition match.[31] The decision to stay home meant less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs.[15]


<br>
<br>
2001–2002: Start of professional career

<br>
<br>
Nadal turned professional at the beginning of 2001, at the age of 14. While most of his contemporaries were making their first steps on the ITF Junior Circuit, Nadal took a different approach and played just two events on the ITF junior Tour, both after turning 16 in 2002,[32] reaching the semifinals of the junior singles event at Wimbledon,[33] and then helping Spain defeat the US in the final of the Junior Davis Cup in his second and final appearance on the ITF Junior Circuit.[33][34] He thus posted a 9–1 career junior record in singles, 4–1 on grass and 5–0 on clay.[33] He had a career-high juniors singles ranking of world No. 145, attained on 30 December 2002.[33]


<br>
<br>
In early 2001, at age 14, Nadal began playing the qualifying draws of professional tournaments. Although he managed to win some matches, he failed to qualify for the main draws in any of the 10 Spanish Futures he played between January and September.[35] He also competed in the qualifying round of the ATP 250 event at home in Mallorca, but failed to qualify.[32] In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.[9][36] Nadal finally made his pro debut in the main draws at the Futures in Madrid on 11 September 2001, wasting no less than 13 match points against Guillermo Platel-Varas in the opening round.[32][29][37] A week later he received a wild card into the main draw of the Challenger in Seville, his first Challenger tournament, and he ousted world No. 751 Israel Matos Gil 6–4 6–4 to claim his first pro win and earn the first five ATP points of his career to become world No. 1002.[35][32][29] At age 15, Nadal ended 2001 as the world No. 811.[35]


<br>
<br>
In 2002, Nadal, then ranked No. 762, received a wild card to the ATP 250 event on his home island of Mallorca,[38] where on 29 April, at 15 years and 10 months of age, Nadal won his first ATP match by defeating No. 81 Ramón Delgado,[39] and became the ninth player in the Open Era to do so before the age of 16.[35][40] He proceeded not to compete for two months as he had to study for school exams, which was a very important thing for his family, thus missing the junior French Open in June.[41] He made his return to the tour in the aforementioned Wimbledon junior event, where he was the only non-English speaking player to receive a wildcard and reaching the semifinals after winning four matches against rivals with much more experience on grass, such as second seed Brian Dabul in the first round and eight seed Philipp Petzschner, who was also two years older than him, in the quarterfinals, before being eliminated by Lamine Ouahab.[42] Nadal then won six of the nine Futures events he entered from July until December, including 5 on clay and 1 on hard courts, but he did not reach any doubles finals.[35][43] Nadal finished 2002 with a Futures record of 40–9 in singles and 10–9 in doubles.[44][45] In October, Nadal achieved his first victory over a top-100 by defeating No. 76 Albert Montañés in the quarterfinals of a Challenger at Barcelona,[16] before losing to Albert Portas in the semifinals.[46] Nadal ended 2002 as the world No. 199.


<br>
<br>
2003: First ATP title and ascending to the top 50

<br>
<br>
Nadal continued his incredible ascent in early 2003, reaching the finals of Challengers at Hamburg, Cherbourg and Cagliari, and winning at Barletta.[35] He scored a total of 19 Challenger wins in the first three months of the season to find himself inside the Top 150.[47] He then qualified for his second career ATP event, the Monte Carlo Masters, where in the second round he beat the 2002 French Open champion Albert Costa, then ranked No. 7, thus getting his first top 10 career win and entering the world’s top 100.[35][48] In his next ATP event, the Torneo Godó in Barcelona, Nadal scored his first ATP bagel in a first round win over Juan Antonio Marín.[49] Nadal then reached his fifth Challenger final of the year in Aix-en-Provence, which he lost to Mariano Puerta.[50] In May, the 16-year-old Nadal entered his second Masters event at Hamburg, where he upset No. 4 Carlos Moyá before losing to future French Open Champion Gaston Gaudio in the third round.[51] Nadal was then forced to postpone his French Open debut after injuring his elbow in a fall while training.[52] He then qualified directly to Wimbledon, thus having never contested in a major qualifying event before.[53] In his major main draw debut in Wimbledon, Nadal defeated Mario Ančić, who at the time was the most recent player to defeat Roger Federer on grass,[47] and then reached the third round to became the youngest man to do so since Boris Becker in 1984.[31][54]


<br>
<br>
In July, Nadal reached the first national final of his career at the Spanish Championship in Majadahonda, where he beat the champion and finalist of the previous edition, Tommy Robredo and Fernando Verdasco, en route to the final, which he lost to Feliciano López.[55] Nadal then participated at Umag, where he lost to Moyá in the semifinals. This remained Nadal's only loss at a clay-court semifinal for the next 12 years, as he then began a streak of 52 consecutive wins in semifinal matches on clay that only ended at the 2015 Rio Open.[56] Nadal also competed in seven doubles tournaments in 2003, and won his first ATP title (doubles or singles) at Umag, partnering Álex López Morón to defeat Todd Perry and Thomas Shimada in the final.[57] Nadal won his second Challenger title of the year in August at Segovia, thus entering the top 50 and winning the ATP Newcomer of the Year Award.[35]


<br>
<br>
At the US Open, Nadal won the first round to became one of the youngest players with a victory at the US Open, but then lost in the second round to Younes El Aynaoui.[58] In September, Nadal entered the final Challenger event of his career, on hard courts in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, retiring with an injury against Richard Gasquet, who never defeated Nadal again.[50][59] Nadal then reached another national final in the Albacete Tournament after overcoming three match points and a headache in the semifinals against Ferrán Ventura to set up another final with López, this time winning comfortably.[60] Nadal finished the year ranked as the world No. 49.[35]


<br>
<br>
2004: Davis Cup title

<br>
<br>
2004 started with a doubles title alongside Tommy Robredo at the Chennai Open, defeating Israeli pair Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram in the final; Nadal’s second doubles title and first on hard courts.[61] In singles, however, Nadal piled up his 5th consecutive loss after a first round exit to Thierry Ascione; this remains the worst losing streak of his career.[62] He bounced back in the very next tournament in Auckland as he reached the first ATP final of his career, which he lost to Dominik Hrbatý.[63] Nadal then reached the third round of the Australian Open, where he lost in straight sets to former world No. 1 and Australian native Lleyton Hewitt.[64] Later that year, Nadal, then ranked No. 34, played the first match of his historic rivalry with Roger Federer, then ranked No. 1, in the third round of the Miami Open, winning in straight sets before a loss to Fernando González in the fourth round.[65][66]


<br>
<br>
In the first tournament of the clay court season at Estoril, Nadal suffered a stress fracture in his left ankle during his round of 16 victory over Richard Gasquet, causing him to miss 3 months of play and 2 majors, the French Open and Wimbledon.[35][9] On his return in July, he struggled to regain his form, and although he won his first ATP singles title at the Prokom Open by defeating No. 105 José Acasuso in the final, Nadal won hardly any other match on the tour.[67] At the US Open, Nadal lost to defending champion Andy Roddick in the second round,[35] but he also entered the tournament's doubles event partnering Robredo, where they upset the No. 4 seed in the third round and reached the semifinals; Nadal's best performance in a grand slam doubles event.[68]


<br>
<br>
In the 2004 Davis Cup final, the 18-year-old Nadal beat world No. 2 Andy Roddick on clay in Spain to help his nation clinch the title over the United States, and in doing so at 18 years and six months of age, he became the youngest player to register a singles victory in a Davis Cup final for a winning nation.[7][31][69] Nadal finished the year ranked as the world No. 51, two places worse than the prior year, mainly because he missed most of the clay court season.[35]


<br>
<br>
2005: First major title

<br>
<br>
Main article: 2005 Rafael Nadal tennis season

<br>
<br>
2005 started with a doubles title alongside Albert Costa at the Qatar Open, defeating pair Andrei Pavel and Mikhail Youzhny in the final.[70] At the 2005 Australian Open, Nadal lost in the fourth round to eventual runner-up Lleyton Hewitt. Two months later, he reached the final of the 2005 Miami Masters, and despite being two points from a straight-sets victory, he was defeated in five sets by No. 1 Roger Federer. Both performances were considered breakthroughs for Nadal.[71][72]


<br>
<br>
He then dominated the spring clay-court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, breaking Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager.[73] Nadal won the Torneo Conde de Godó in Barcelona after defeating the former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final; a triumph that propelled him into the top 10 for the first time in his career.[74] He then beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Italian Open. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5[75] and made him one of the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the French Open semifinals, being one of only four players to defeat him that year (along with Marat Safin, Richard Gasquet, and David Nalbandian). Two days later he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second man, after Mats Wilander in 1982, to win the French Open on his first attempt.[36] He also became the first male teenager to win a major singles title since Pete Sampras won the 1990 US Open at age 19.[9][76] Winning improved his ranking to No. 3.[75]


<br>
<br>
Three days after his victory in Paris, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round of the grass court Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany, where he lost to No. 147 Alexander Waske,[77] the second lowest-ranked defeat of his career.[78] He then lost in the second round of 2005 Wimbledon to No. 69 Gilles Müller of Luxembourg.[79] Nadal then played at the Copa del Rey de Tenis in Huelva, the oldest tournament in Spain on clay, beating Carlos Moyá in the final.[80] Following his Wimbledon loss, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, the Swedish Open, Stuttgart Open, and the Canada Masters, defeating Agassi in the final of the latter to win the first hardcourt title of his career[76] and to bring his ranking to No. 2 on 25 July 2005, where he remained for the next three years behind Roger Federer.[35] His winning streak ended in the first round of the Cincinnati Open at the hands of Tomáš Berdych.[81] Nadal was seeded second at the 2005 US Open, but was upset in the third round by No. 49 James Blake in four sets.[82]


<br>
<br>
In September, he defeated Coria in the final of the China Open in Beijing and won both of his Davis Cup matches against Italy.[83] In October, he won his fourth Masters title of the year, coming back from two sets down to prevail against Ivan Ljubičić in the final of the 2005 Madrid Masters, his biggest indoor title to this day.[29][76][84] He then suffered a foot injury that prevented him from competing in the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup.[85]


<br>
<br>
Both Nadal and Federer won eleven singles titles and four Masters titles in 2005. Nadal broke Mats Wilander's previous teenage record of nine in 1983.[7][86] Eight of Nadal's titles were on clay, and the remainder were on hard courts. Nadal won 79 matches, second only to Federer's 81. Also, he earned the highest year-end ranking ever by a Spaniard and the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year award.[35]


<br>
<br>
2006: Second French Open title

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Nadal missed the Australian Open because of a foot injury.[87] In February, he lost in the semifinals of the first tournament he played, the Open 13 tournament in Marseille. Two weeks later, he handed Roger Federer his first loss of the year in the final of the Dubai Open (in 2006, Nadal and Andy Murray were the only two men who defeated Federer), thus ending Federer’s 56-match winning streak on hard courts.[88] Nadal was then upset in both the semifinals of the Indian Wells Open by James Blake, and in the second round of the Miami Masters by Carlos Moyá, who thus ended Nadal's 22-match win streak over fellow Spaniard players.[89]

<br>
<br>
On European clay, Nadal won all four tournaments he entered and 24 consecutive matches. He defeated Federer in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters in four sets.[90] The following week, he defeated Tommy Robredo in the final of the Torneo Godó tournament in Barcelona.[91] After a one-week break, Nadal won Italian Open title defeating Federer in a fifth-set tiebreaker in the final, after saving two match points and equaling Björn Borg's tally of 16 ATP titles won as a teenager.[31][76] At five hours and five minutes, this is the longest match Federer and Nadal have ever contested and it is considered to be where the Federer–Nadal rivalry began in earnest, with The New York Times comparing it to the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing on the following day.[92] Nadal then broke Argentinian Guillermo Vilas's 29-year male record of 53 consecutive clay-court match victories by beating Robin Söderling in the first round of the French Open.[93][94] Vilas presented Nadal with a trophy, but commented later that Nadal's feat was less impressive than his own because Nadal's winning streak covered two years and was accomplished by adding easy tournaments to his schedule.[95] Nadal went on to face Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, the first-ever meeting of their historic rivalry, which Nadal won via a retirement from Djokovic after Nadal took the first two sets.[96] He then beat Ivan Ljubičić to set up a final against Federer. The first two sets of the match were hardly competitive, as the rivals traded 6–1 sets. Nadal won the third set easily and won the fourth in a tiebreaker to become the first player to defeat Federer in a Grand Slam tournament final.[97]


<br>
<br>
Nadal injured his shoulder during a quarterfinal match against Lleyton Hewitt at the Artois Championships, played on grass at the Queen's Club in London.[98] Nadal was unable to complete the match, which ended his 26-match winning streak. Nadal was seeded second at Wimbledon, and was two points from defeat against American qualifier Robert Kendrick in the second round before coming back to win in five sets.[99] In the third round, Nadal defeated No. 20 Andre Agassi in straight sets in Agassi's last career match at Wimbledon.[100] Nadal also won his next three matches in straight sets, which set up his first Wimbledon final, which was against Federer, who had won this tournament the three previous years. Nadal was the first Spanish man since Manuel Santana in 1966, to reach the Wimbledon final, but Federer won the match in four sets to win his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title.[101]


<br>
<br>
During the lead up to the US Open, Nadal played the two Masters tournaments in North America. He was upset in the third round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto and in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Open by Juan Carlos Ferrero. Nadal was seeded second at the US Open, but lost in the quarterfinals to No. 54 Mikhail Youzhny in four sets.[102]


<br>
<br>
Nadal played only three tournaments for the remainder of the year. Joachim Johansson, ranked No. 690, upset Nadal in the second round of the Stockholm Open.[78][103] The following week, Nadal lost to Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals of the Madrid Masters. During the round-robin stage of the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Nadal lost to James Blake but defeated Nikolay Davydenko and Robredo. Because of those two victories, Nadal qualified for the semifinals, where he lost to Federer. This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.[104]


<br>
<br>
Nadal went on to become the first player since Andre Agassi in 1994–95 to finish the year ranked No. 2 in consecutive years.


<br>
<br>
2007: Third French Open title

<br>
<br>
Main article: 2007 Rafael Nadal tennis season

<br>
<br>
At the Australian Open, Nadal lost in the quarterfinals to eventual runner-up Fernando González.[105] After another quarterfinal loss at the Dubai Tennis Championships, he won the Indian Wells Open after beating Novak Djokovic in the final, before losing to Djokovic in the quarterfinals of the 2007 Miami Masters.[106]


<br>
<br>
He had comparatively more success after returning to Europe to play five clay-court tournaments. He won the titles at the Monte-Carlo Masters, the Torneo Godó in Barcelona, and the Italian Open, before losing to Roger Federer in the final of the Hamburg Masters.[107] This defeat ended his 81-match winning streak on clay, which is the male Open Era record for consecutive wins on a single surface. He bounced back quickly in the French Open, not dropping a set en route to the final where he faced Federer once again, this time winning in four sets to join Björn Borg as the only man to win three French Open titles in a row since Anthony Wilding in 1914.[108] Between the tournaments in Barcelona and Rome, Nadal defeated Federer in the "Battle of Surfaces" exhibition match in Mallorca, with the tennis court being half grass and half clay.[109][110]


<br>
<br>
Nadal was upset in the quarterfinals of the Artois Championships at the Queen's Club in London for the second consecutive year. Nadal then won consecutive five-set matches during the third and fourth rounds of Wimbledon before being beaten by Federer in the five-set final. This was Federer's first five-set match at Wimbledon since 2001.[111] In July, Nadal beat the unseeded Stan Wawrinka in the final of the clay-court Stuttgart Open, which proved to be his last title of the year.[112] In the North American summer hard court season, Nadal was a semifinalist at the Canadian Masters in Montreal before losing his first match at the Cincinnati Open.[113] He was the second-seeded player at the US Open, but was defeated in the fourth round by David Ferrer.[114]


<br>
<br>
After a month-long break, Nadal played Madrid Masters and Paris Masters, but David Nalbandian beat him in straight sets in the quarterfinals and final of those tournaments.[115] To end the year, Nadal won two of his three-round robin matches to advance to the semifinals of the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, where Federer defeated him in straight sets.[116]


<br>
<br>
During the second half of the year, Nadal battled a knee injury suffered during the Wimbledon final. In addition, there were rumors at the end of the year that the foot injury he suffered during 2005, caused long-term damage, which were given credence by coach Toni Nadal's claim that the problem was "serious". Nadal and his spokesman strongly denied this, however, with Nadal himself calling the story "totally false".[117]
